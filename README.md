# Hello World Project

## Overview
This is my first project in CSE 310: Applied Programming. The program prints "Hello World" to the screen. I chose JavaScript for this example because it is lightweight and runs easily with Node.js. This project is mainly to practice setting up my GitHub repo, using README.md, and making sure my development environment is ready for future modules.
